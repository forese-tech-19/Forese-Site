                  The mock placements is a three phase event consisting of an aptitude test, a group discussion and finally the actual mock
                  placements. Your aptitude test score and group discussion performance play a pivotal role and will help you achieve a
                  headstart over your peers during the mock placements. We have thus prepared a curated collection of sample resume formats,

                    <h4>Aptitude Test</h4>
                    <p>
                      The Aptitude Assessment Test is one in which the candidate’s dexterity and cognitive skills are assessed. The students
                      are tested on their English and Technical knowledge, where a different set of questions are allotted for each
                      department. This helps the participants identify fields of study which need to be tweaked. It also throws light on how
                      aptitude tests would take place during campus placements. The marks scored, along with the Group Discussion scores,
                      are put up for evaluation to the recruiters in the Mock Placements. On the other hand, this enables a standardized
                      method for the recruiters to evaluate and score a candidate’s skills, with quantified results for comparison against
                      other applicants. The event delivers an opportunity for students to experience an aptitude test and develop their
                      problem solving abilities.

                    <p>
                      Group Discussions offer a first-hand experience of recruitments, through which the student’s communicative skills are
                      assessed. Each student attends a round of GD, through which they identify areas of potential improvement pertaining to
                      general knowledge, debate and presentation skills. The students are evaluated based on their ability to put forth
                      their views and their receptiveness to other’s opinions. The marks, along with those of the Aptitude Assessment Test,
                      are reviewed by the recruiters on the day of Mock Placements. To the recruiters, the Group Discussions act as a
                      simulated managerial environment. It helps them in identifying individuals with proficient leadership and
                      interpersonal skills. The event provides a platform to test the entrant’s analytical prowess and their ability to
                      think on their feet. Here your thought process and tone of delivery will be part of the criteria of judgement.
